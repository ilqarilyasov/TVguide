## Library

* I haven't used any third-party library for this project. 
* I have used Alamofire before but I like to use URLSession, it left me easily debug if there is a decoding or network error.

## Improvement

* Chacing photos will definetly improve the performance
* If a cell isn't on the screen or scrolled away then we can cancel the fetch photo operation to save users network data and make the app more performant
